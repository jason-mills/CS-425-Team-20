I think that ideally I don't want to deal with any of this.
I want to pass this information to my renderer and then in a loop just call draw on it
I want everything else to be handled by the thing itself

Steps to rendering
1. enable depth testing
2. set depth function to less
3. create vertex buffer, bind buffer, add data to that buffer
4. create vertex array object, bind vertex array, enable
